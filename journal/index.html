			<h3>Best Practices for Modals</h3>

            <p>After reading Naema Baskanderi's article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,"</a> I gained a better understanding of when and how modals should be used effectively. Initially intended to simplify UI and save space, modals have now become overused, often frustrating users rather than improving their experience.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most important takeaways was the need for accessibility in modal design. I found it interesting that modals should always have an "escape hatch," allowing users to close them with a button, escape key, or by clicking outside. Without these, users may feel trapped, leading to frustration.</p>
            
            <p>The article also emphasized that modals should be user-initiated. This insight resonated with me because I've personally been annoyed by unexpected pop-ups that disrupt my flow. Modals should only appear as a result of deliberate user actions, like clicking a button or selecting an option.</p>
            
            <p>The section on mobile usability was particularly eye-opening. Since modals don't work well on small screens due to space limitations and touch interactions, alternative UI patterns like inline expansions or toast notifications are often better choices.</p>

			<p>Overall, this article changed my perspective on modal usage. Moving forward, I'll be more mindful about when and how I implement modals, ensuring they serve a clear purpose without disrupting the user experience.</p>

			<h3>Form Design Best Practices</h3>

            <p>After studying form design principles, in the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design,"</asrc></a> I've learned that the "less is more" approach is crucial. The article emphasizes that minimizing input fields is fundamental. It explained that every unnecessary question increases the risk of form abandonment. This was interesting to learn because I previously thought more information was always better.</p>
            
            <p>One design principle that surprised me was the effectiveness of single-column layouts. Multiple columns, while space-efficient, actually slow users down by interrupting their vertical scanning flow. The exception is for related short fields like city, state, and zip code, which can be grouped horizontally.</p>
            
            <p>The article's insights about placeholder text were particularly interesting. While I used to think placeholders were helpful, they can actually hurt usability since they disappear when users start typing. Instead, it's better to use clear labels above fields and provide any extra instructions in permanent supporting text.</p>
            
            <p>I evaluated <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">Google</a>'s sign-in form using these principles. They do very well at minimalism, requiring only email/phone and password fields. The form follows the recommended single-column layout and uses clear, persistent labels above each field. I particularly appreciate their "show password" option and how they provide helpful error messages inline.</p>

			<p>Overall, this research has changed how I'll approach form design in my future projects, focusing on reducing cognitive load and increasing accessibility rather than just collecting data.</p>
