			<h3>Part I: Response to my Partner's Images</h3>
		
			<p>When sharing in class with my partner, she explained several different ideas she was considering. These included her cat's favorite items displayed in an animation where you could hover and learn more about each item, a closet of her dog's clothes that you could click on to see her dog wearing them, and a magnet collection on a fridge where clicking on a magnet would reveal details about where it came from. However, the images she submitted were focused on a different idea—collections of flowers on her desk, which you could click on to learn more about the flowers and how to care for them.</p>
		
			<p>The most interesting aspects of the images are the vibrant colors and the variety of textures in the flower arrangements, which make them visually striking. The most obvious element is the deliberate way the flowers are arranged, which makes the images feel curated. However, the inclusion of a horse-drawn carriage in the background adds a mysterious element, as it's not immediately clear how it connects to the overall theme of flower collections.</p>
		
			<p>In discussing her ideas, I found the magnets and the cat's items to be the most unique and personal concepts. The magnet idea, in particular, felt deeply tied to her experiences and stood out as an opportunity to tell a meaningful story. Compared to these, the flower concept felt less personal, which made it less compelling. To elevate the flower concept, I suggested she incorporate a narrative that ties the flowers to her own life or explore alternative photographic approaches, such as using dramatic angles or lighting, to make the images more expressive and visually engaging.</p>

			<h3>Part II: Reflection on my Ideas</h3>
		
			<p>The image I'm most excited about for my project is a photo I took in Amsterdam while rowing through the canals. The image captures a serene moment, with the iconic architecture of Amsterdam reflected in the still water of the canal. What makes this image particularly meaningful to me is the memory it represents—feeling completely immersed in the city, experiencing it from a unique perspective that felt peaceful and personal. This emotional connection is not something you would immediately gather from just looking at the image itself.</p>
		
			<p>This photo ties into my project idea of creating a globe that highlights the locations I've visited, with photos attached to each destination. While the concept of travel as a theme is not particularly unique, I've been brainstorming ways to make it more engaging. My partner suggested adding animations, such as footsteps or modes of transportation, to bring the project to life. Additionally, I've been considering narrowing the scope to focus specifically on my internship abroad, which would give the project a more cohesive and personal narrative.</p>
		
			<p>To make the images themselves more compelling, I could include photos of myself interacting with these locations, rather than just focusing on the landscapes. This would add a personal dimension and make the project feel less like a generic travel collection and more like a reflection of my individual experiences. These adjustments would help transform the project into something more dynamic and memorable.</p>

			<h3>Visual Thinking and Interaction Design</h3>
		
			<p>After reading the article, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills,"</a> I realized how much depth there is in analyzing images through critical thinking. The article highlighted how photographs can be used to teach close reading skills, encouraging viewers to ask questions, analyze details, and uncover deeper meanings. I found it fascinating how this approach can enhance creativity and visual literacy, which are essential for design.</p>
		
			<p>To further explore visual thinking, I evaluated the <a href="https://gufram.it/en/">Gufram</a> website featured on <a href="https://Awwwards.com/">Awwards.com</a>. This site stood out to me for its innovative use of interaction and bold visual style. The vibrant colors, playful animations, and seamless transitions created an immersive experience that reflects the brand's eccentric and artistic identity. I was inspired by how the site uses interaction to engage users while staying true to its unique personality.</p>

			<p>However, I noticed some drawbacks. The site's emphasis on creativity sometimes comes at the expense of usability. Navigation wasn't always intuitive, and certain design choices felt overwhelming, which could frustrate users unfamiliar with the brand. This highlighted the importance of balancing aesthetics and functionality in interaction design.</p>
				
			<p>Overall, this exploration deepened my understanding of visual thinking. Images and interaction have the power to tell stories, evoke emotions, and create connections, but they must also be accessible and purposeful. Moving forward, I'll strive to design experiences that are both visually compelling and user-friendly.</p>

			<h3>Best Practices for Modals</h3>

            <p>After reading Naema Baskanderi's article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,"</a> I gained a better understanding of when and how modals should be used effectively. Initially intended to simplify UI and save space, modals have now become overused, often frustrating users rather than improving their experience.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most important takeaways was the need for accessibility in modal design. I found it interesting that modals should always have an "escape hatch," allowing users to close them with a button, escape key, or by clicking outside. Without these, users may feel trapped, leading to frustration.</p>
            
            <p>The article also emphasized that modals should be user-initiated. This insight resonated with me because I've personally been annoyed by unexpected pop-ups that disrupt my flow. Modals should only appear as a result of deliberate user actions, like clicking a button or selecting an option.</p>
            
            <p>The section on mobile usability was particularly eye-opening. Since modals don't work well on small screens due to space limitations and touch interactions, alternative UI patterns like inline expansions or toast notifications are often better choices.</p>

			<p>Overall, this article changed my perspective on modal usage. Moving forward, I'll be more mindful about when and how I implement modals, ensuring they serve a clear purpose without disrupting the user experience.</p>

			<h3>Form Design Best Practices</h3>

            <p>After studying form design principles, in the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design,"</asrc></a> I've learned that the "less is more" approach is crucial. The article emphasizes that minimizing input fields is fundamental. It explained that every unnecessary question increases the risk of form abandonment. This was interesting to learn because I previously thought more information was always better.</p>
            
            <p>One design principle that surprised me was the effectiveness of single-column layouts. Multiple columns, while space-efficient, actually slow users down by interrupting their vertical scanning flow. The exception is for related short fields like city, state, and zip code, which can be grouped horizontally.</p>
            
            <p>The article's insights about placeholder text were particularly interesting. While I used to think placeholders were helpful, they can actually hurt usability since they disappear when users start typing. Instead, it's better to use clear labels above fields and provide any extra instructions in permanent supporting text.</p>
            
            <p>I evaluated <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">Google</a>'s sign-in form using these principles. They do very well at minimalism, requiring only email/phone and password fields. The form follows the recommended single-column layout and uses clear, persistent labels above each field. I particularly appreciate their "show password" option and how they provide helpful error messages inline.</p>

			<p>Overall, this research has changed how I'll approach form design in my future projects, focusing on reducing cognitive load and increasing accessibility rather than just collecting data.</p>
